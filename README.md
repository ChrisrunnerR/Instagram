# Finished Project : 
I created this project using Flutter - which allows my Application to run in IOS,android, and Web 
Using Firebase I was able to 
  1) Store User Login using Google Authentication: FirebaseAuth
  2) Store User information like Name, bio, profile picture: FireStore
  3) Store user images that can be uploaded

With my app you can 
 1) create a new new profile or you can login to an existing account
 2) post images which will be visible on your profile screen, or main feed, or when someone searches for your username
